How it works! 🧠
1. Defining:
- A list of content ideas that we want to do.
- A load of options of best positng times.
- The days of the week.

2: The Script:
- Loops through each day.
- Assigns a content idea (I'm just building the idea so right now it's going to be reused or randomized as needed).
- Applies the best posting times. (From exprience or data given).
- Generates the correct date.
- Stores everything in a schedule list.

3. Lastly, the schdule is exported as a CSV file to look at later.
