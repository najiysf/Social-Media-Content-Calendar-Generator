# Social-Media-Content-Calendar-Generator
Generates a weekly social media content calendar by assigning content ideas to optimal posting days with specific times using engagement data, exporting the final schedule to  CSV for planning and analysis.

How it works! 🧠
1. Defining:
- A list of content ideas that we want to do.
- A load of options of best positng times.
- The days of the week.

2: The Script:
- Loops through each day.
- Assigns a content idea (I'm just building the idea so right now it's going to be reused or randomized as needed).
- Applies the best posting times. (From exprience or data given).
- Generates the correct date.
- Stores everything in a schedule list.

3. Lastly, the schdule is exported as a CSV file to look at later.
